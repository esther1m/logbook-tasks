        Since a young age, Esther has loved to read, often checking out 6 books from the library to read within the three week loaning period. As Esther grew, she lost interest in reading
        as it was now a required activity for school as opposed to something she does in her spare time for fun. Then came the rise of <span style="color: brown; font-style: italic;"  >BOOKTOK</span>
        with all it's creative approaches to immersive yourself in reading. Annotating, tabbing and talking about your favourite books with enthusiasm - reading had become <i> trendy. </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks to booktok, Esther decided to try reading again, admist the busy sixth form life. She started with this book:

        <img src="the inheritance games.webp" alt="A picture of The Inheritance Games, a book by Jennifer Lynn Barnes. The cover has an emerald green background with the tyle splashed across in bold typography." style="width: 225px;display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;">
        <p>
            Esther really enjoyed the twists in the story, finding it refreshing to read a book where she could not predict the plot or the twists it had. This book reignited her passion for reading.
